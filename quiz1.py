# fun with strings
# Write a method is_palindrome(string) that determines whether a given string (word or
# phrase) is a palindrome, that is, it reads the same backwards as forwards, ignoring
# case, punctuation, and nonword characters. (A "nonword character" is defined for our
# purposes as "a character that python regexps would treat as a nonword character".)

# Here is a template

def is_palindrome(string):
    pass # your code here

# Define a function count_words(string) that, given an input string, return a dict whose
# keys are words in the string and whose values are the number of times each word
# appears. Your code should look like:

def count_words(string):
    pass # your code here
